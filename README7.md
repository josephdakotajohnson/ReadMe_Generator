## Credits

 - This website was coded by Joseph Dakota Johnson.

 - Instructor Caleb Crum helped me during class by determining with me if I met all the project requirements and how to turn them in. [Caleb's GitHub account](https://github.com/CalebCrumInstructor)

 - Tutor Andres Jimenez helped me during a tutoring session by helping me figure out how to create the markdown (or 'licenses') Badges, create an array of different objects for multiple answers to the 'credits2' and 'features' questions in the prompt, and helped me add spaces to the 'credits2', 'features', and 'badges'  questions in the prompt.

 - My brother (boot camp graduate) helped out by helping me figure out Screencastify in order to turn in this homework assignment. [Dylan's GitHub account](https://github.com/dylanstormjohnson)



## Badges

 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript

## Features

 - When the user types, "node index.js", into the terminal, the user is prompted with 9 questions that allow the user to input what will be on a README.md.
 - Then the user is provided with a, "Successfully wrote a README.md" response.
 - If the user looks at this third feature in the README.md, he or she has found this challenge's Easter Egg.  Good job (and sorry for the lazy Easter Egg)!
